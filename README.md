<h1>Exploring the Intricacies of Online Security - My Adventure with Honeypots and SIEM</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved creating a secure Azure environment to visualize and analyze cyber attacks on a deliberately exposed virtual machine. By setting up an Azure subscription, configuring a vulnerable virtual machine, creating a Log Analytics Workspace to collect logs, and implementing Azure Sentinel as the SIEM solution, this project showcases the importance of robust security measures in cloud computing. The custom PowerShell script enriched log entries with geographical data, enabling a visual representation of attack origins on a global map. This project aims to raise awareness about cybersecurity in cloud environments and highlight the significance of protecting sensitive data from potential threats.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell:</b> A custom PowerShell script was used to extract IP addresses from failed login attempts on the vulnerable virtual machine. This script facilitated the communication with the third-party API to gather geographical data for log enrichment.
- <b>Azure Sentinel:</b> Microsoft's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution was utilized to analyze and visualize the collected log data. Azure Sentinel offers advanced threat intelligence and detection capabilities.
- <b>Third-Party Geolocation API:</b> A third-party application programming interface (API) was integrated with the PowerShell script to obtain geographical information based on IP addresses. This API enriched the log entries with data such as latitude, longitude, country, state, and province.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Azure Cloud Environment:</b> The project primarily revolved around Microsoft Azure, where an Azure subscription was set up to access various cloud services.
- <b>Azure Virtual Machine:</b> A virtual machine was created within the Azure environment to simulate a real-world scenario. Its security measures were deliberately weakened to expose it to potential attacks.
- <b>Log Analytics Workspace:</b> An Azure Log Analytics Workspace was established to serve as a centralized repository for collecting and storing logs generated by the vulnerable virtual machine.
